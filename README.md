## Getting started

This is a file introducing this source code, environment, and how to install this source.

## Environment

This project is a flutter app
- [See how to install flutter, introducing flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

Version:
- Flutter 2.10.5 â€¢ channel stable â€¢ https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
- Dart 2.16.2  null-safety

## Source structure

This source code use MVC architecture with model, controller, view. Structure and folder will devide follow:

## Dependencies
All dependencies will define on file pubspec.yaml. Some important dependencies are frameworks for source code such as:
- get: we use getX for project by easy to use, clean architecture, more utils.
- chopper: use do RestAPI call.
- json_serializable: auto generate toJson, fromJson

## Run

```
flutter pub get
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
flutter run
```
To update or create splash
```
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

## Test and Deploy

Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.
